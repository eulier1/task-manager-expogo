1. No routing required, therefore no App folder
2. Following the src folder structure just by convetion.
3. Design might not be according to UI System Design Guidelines for iOS or Android

1. Statusbar on expo go, doesn't change the status style to light/dark, this will work with native builds [PR#26369](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/26369)
